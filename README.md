## SCSS

Styles were copied from https://github.com/kevin-powell/astro-sass-template-no-scoped-styles, and modified were from there.

They follow [CUBE](https://cube.fyi/).

## Svelte

If using a svelte component, remember to add `client:load` when invoking the component so that it appropriately runs client-side.

## Adding a youtube video or iframe?

Use this structure:

```html
<div class="youtube-wrapper">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncwV3cJinC8?si=CAY9FaDqG431jPYf"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
