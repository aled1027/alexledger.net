## SCSS

Styles were copied from https://github.com/kevin-powell/astro-sass-template-no-scoped-styles, and modified were from there.

They follow [CUBE](https://cube.fyi/).

## Svelte

If using a svelte component, remember to add `client:load` when invoking the component so that it appropriately runs client-side.
