# Lists

<AutoToc />

I love making lists. Lists of things I like, things I don't like, ranking them, power-ranking them - it's all fun.

This page is a bunch of lists I made.
It starts with the Spotlight, lists that shout-out people and organizations I love.
Following that is lists of books. Don't worry, more lists will be added here over time.

{/*
More Lists Ideas:
- Things I'd Like to Have
  - For example: email -> RSS converter (like for something like https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/, or a paid substack feed)
*/}



## Spotlight

This section, Spotlight, includes lists of folks and organizations whose work I love. I made this to help boost their profiles, offering another spot where they might be found in the world.
