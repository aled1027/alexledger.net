## About Spotlight

This page, Spotlight, includes lists of folks and organizations whose work I love. I made this page to help boost their profiles, offering another spot where they might be found in the world.

I'd love to hear from you, reader, about who you think is doing cool work. Consider adding a page like this to your site, and if you don't yet have a site, I encourage that first. (If you're not sure where to start, please free to reach out to me!)

This page had a number of inspirations, including, but not limited to:
