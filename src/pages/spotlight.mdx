### More News Sources That Are Not As Vetted

## About Spotlight

This page, Spotlight, includes lists of folks and organizations whose work I love. I made this page to help boost their profiles, offering another spot where they might be found in the world.

I'd love to hear from you, reader, about who you think is doing cool work. Consider adding a page like this to your site, and if you don't yet have a site, I encourage that first. (If you're not sure where to start, please free to reach out to me!)

This page had a number of inspirations, including, but not limited to:

  [Neat Websites](https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/neat-websites/), and

  - Tracy Durnell expands on the ideas in this [post](https://tracydurnell.com/2022/10/28/expanding-the-blogroll/).

[^1]: Disclaimer: this list is based on my research, and it's possible, perhaps even likely, that I missed yellow and red flags signaling that we shouldn't trust these organizations. That being said, to the best of my present knowledge, I can recommend these. If you come across information to the contrary, please feel free to reach out to me to so we can keep this list high quality.
[^2]: Note that if an organization does not pass the vetting process, they are not included and there is no "failed vetting" list. This is not intended to be a take-down; this is intended to be a list of recommended organizations.
