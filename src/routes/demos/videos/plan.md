Take links to videos on cloudflares
Each link is a video of a website i've made

Put these into a single shader
So we'd have a bunch of uniform textures that are videos getting updated
Then play with some basic effects
We could treat them like SDFs

If we have them as instances
Where the video is on a a cube and the cube just moves around
So what if we have 6 and the cube moves around, kind a screensaver

We can call this is the screensaver
