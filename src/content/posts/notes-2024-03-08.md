Trying out a format this time without bullet points.

## What I'm Reading

I just finished [Let's Become Fungal](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/let-s-become-fungal) by Yasmine Ostendorf-Rodr√≠guez, and this was one of the best non-fiction books I've read in the last few years It reviews what we can learn from fungi to live more ethically and with understanding

[Valiz](https://valiz.nl/): The publisher of Let's Become Fungal who has many amazing books

[Future Materials Bank](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/): A collection of "materials that support the transition towards a more sustainable artistic practice"
Here are the pages on [kombucha](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/kombucha/) and [scoby](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/scoby-compo-handbags-crafting-organic-waste-for-fashion/).

"How will you useless to capitalism today?" - [The Nap Ministry](https://thenapministry.wordpress.com/2021/08/03/how-will-you-be-useless-to-capitalism-today/)

I'm considering adding an email subscription to this site, and I'm thinking I'd use Ghost. Here's [one account](https://www.citationneeded.news/citation-needed-has-a-new-home) of switching from Substack to Ghost that I've found useful.

## What I'm Doing

I'm trying out [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) in place of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - which are both supercharged spotlight alternatives on macs. So far I'm really impressed. Raycast feels faster, more powerful, and easier to configure, and I had already thought that Alfred was impressive. Alfred felt a bit more open, like more people contributing extensions, but that might have just been perception and I'll see over time.

I'm learning to play [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge).

I added an Info component where a user can click an info icon to view more information about a topic. You can see it in action on the [lists](/lists) page and source code is [here](https://github.com/aled1027/alexledger.net/blob/main/src/components/InfoHover.astro). (Disclaimer: it's still a work in progress.) I want to turn it into a web component, as right now it's an astro component, which would afford me to use it in `.md` files, not just `.mdx` and `.astro` files.
