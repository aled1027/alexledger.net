## What I'm Reading

- [Taza Chocolate Transparency Report](the taza chocolate transparency report https://www.tazachocolate.com/pages/2023-transparency-report)
- [My Unified Theory of Shutdown and Meltdown](https://bix.blog/2023/04/13/my-unified-field-theory-of-shutdown-and-meltdown/) (note: note _mine_, but the author's)

## A Cultural Prediction: Free Will

I predict that over the next 5 or 10 years, we're going to see an increase of movies, books, songs and art generally considering that Free Will doesn't exist in some nuanced context.

I'm thinking about this in the vein of [Robert Sapolsky's book Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will](https://bookshop.org/p/books/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will-robert-m-sapolsky/19662545?ean=9780525560975) and [Sam Harris's book Free Will](https://www.samharris.org/books/free-will).

I haven't read either of these books, but I've consumed various contents and thoughts around them. I'm not sure exactly why, but our culture feels primed to embrace these ideas.

I'd guess that the ideas might be explored in a similar way to how multi-verses were used as mechanisms to explore personal & sociocultural ideas like immigrations, personal choices, parenting and queerness in Everything Everywhere All At Once and other works.
