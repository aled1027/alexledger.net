title: 2023 Gift Guides

Here's a collection of gift guides and lists that I've found useful as I start up my 2023 holiday shopping.

- [Robin Sloan's 2023 Gift Guide](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/2023-gift-guide/)
- [Fat Gold's 2023 Gift Guide](https://fat.gold/field-report/30/)
- [Tracy Durnell's Small Goodies from Indie Businesses](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/08/small-goodies-from-indie-businesses/)
- [Chris Coyier's 2023 Gift Guide](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/12/06/gift-guide-2023/)
- My list of [Portland-area Fermentation](/posts/portlandarea-fermentation) organizations
- My spotlight page of [artists](/spotlight#artists) and [businesses](/spotlight#businesses)

Even though a number of the recommendations aren't local to Portland or the PNW, these helped me think more creatively about shopping local, got the wheels turning up in the rusty attic.
