Why have a website?

- For some it's clarity. Clarifying who they are to the world over a presentation on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media.

- Cat's website
  - Creating a world
    > This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works (the “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!)
  - talk
  - liminality
  - sci-fi
  - no guarantee you can still be yourself after the change
    - exploring permanent change
  - Batty forgoing established routes of the physical environment
  - Batty preferring spatial transgression, evoking his daily transgression
