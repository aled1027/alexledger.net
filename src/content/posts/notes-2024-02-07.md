## What I'm Reading

- [How to Get On](https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/)
  - A set of guides for navigating issues around disability, like social security. I like this example of a digital garden for a specific purpose.
- [Quadratic](https://app.quadratichq.com/)
  - Quadratic is an infinite sheet canvas, like google sheets, that supports python and javascript and excel formulas. I think I could do some cool things with Quadratic that I currently magyver with scripts. I learned Quadratic about in this [blog post](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/discovering-newsletter-links-with-quadratic/).
- [Dorian Taylor](https://doriantaylor.com/person/dorian-taylor#me)
  - Dorian Taylor writes about information management and archiving, topics that I'm interested in thinking more about. On this page, Dorian has a talk on using intensional categories.
- [the (lack of) capacity to love one’s work](https://winnielim.org/journal/the-lack-of-capacity-to-love-ones-work/)
  - A reflection on disability intersecting with loving one's work
- [An ancient Egyptian temple in New York inspires a Lebanese American musician](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/27/1226836657/h-sinno-mashrou-leila-temple-of-dendur)
  - Reminds me of [Razia's Shadow](https://www.raziasshadow.com/) but more social/political
- [Today’s YouTubers are repeating the mistakes of yesterday’s bloggers](https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2024/02/05/todays-youtubers-are-repeating-the-mistakes-of-yesterdays-bloggers/)
  - Not sure I 100% agree, but it's a topic that's in the zeitgeist and I'm thinking about.
- [A unified theory of fucks](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/unified-theory-of------)
  - "Don’t give a fuck about your work. Give all your fucks to the living." I don't have a lot fucks left for non-living things right now. I like it.

## What I'm Doing

- Check out my short [guide to 2024 elections in Oregon](/guides/2024-guide-to-voting-in-portland).
- Working on a post about the ethics around shopping and groceries
- Reading reading reading. I have so many books from the library right now to work through.
