## What I'm Reading

- [Baldur Bjarnason reflects on his projects](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/sunk-cost-fallacy-research-project/)
	- In this series of posts, Baldur Bjarnason reflects on his recent projects. I like the retrospective analysis, being clear about what he would have done differently in the past and what he's going to do differently next time. A lot of the ideas are resonating pretty hard with me as it seems my projects can be, or are, structured similarly to his.
- [Refusal](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/refusal)
	- Mandy Brown has prompted me to return to ideas around restorative justice. This excerpt and analysis in particular stood out to me for how it situates engagement and disengagement in conflict.
- [https://chuck.is/dumb/](https://chuck.is/dumb/)
	- An approach to having a _dumb_ phone
	- I've been thinking about what I want for my next phone, and I like this approach. One big thing I ran into when looking at alternative phones was the lack of support for messaging apps like Signal; I more or less *need* Signal, or another secure messaging app that my friends also have, which made almost all of the alternative phones that are designed for privacy a non-starter.
- [Shirley Wu](https://shirleywu.studio/)
	- Love Shirley's data visualizations and story telling. I've been learning more about d3.js from her on youtube as well.
- [Graham Duncan](https://grahamduncan.blog/)
- [Advent of Technical Writing](https://jamesg.blog/category/advent-of-technical-writing/)
- [Disability Visibility: First Person Stories from the Twenty-First Century](https://bookshop.org/p/books/disability-visibility-first-person-stories-from-the-twenty-first-century-alice-wong/13840332)
	- Gifted to me for Christmas, this book dramatically expanded how I think about disability.
- [Bluets by Maggie Nelson](https://bookshop.org/p/books/bluets-maggie-nelson/10726275?ean=9781933517407)
	- I'm in the middle right now, and it's hard to express my current thoughts & feelings.
