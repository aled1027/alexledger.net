- [The Web That Has No Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-web-that-has-no-weaver-understanding-chinese-medicine-ted-kaptchuk/10175540?ean=9780809228409) by Ted Kaptchuk

## What I'm Doing

- I updated alexledger.net to use TinaCMS for the convenience. It's generally helping me write more easily, and it's easier to get new posts going with quick drafts that I can gradually build up into full pieces. I wrote a blog post on the technical aspects a few days ago: [post](/posts/a-brief-look-at-tinacms).
- I posted a guide on [portland grocery stores](/guides/portland-grocery-stores)
