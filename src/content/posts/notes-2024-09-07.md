## What I'm Reading

- [Oceans of Power and Tincture of Reproof](https://buttondown.com/danbouk/archive/oceans-of-power-and-a-tincture-of-reproof/) - A beautiful essay on power, how we perceive of it, and how we think about it as a time progresses. I had some many thoughts from reading this piece, and I'm sure it's influencing how I view the world. It makes me think about the Ursula le Guin quote:

> “The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist; a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.” [link](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/22798-the-trouble-is-that-we-have-a-bad-habit-encouraged)

- A really nice, compact python file that executes a spreadsheet engine. The blog post and the code are quite enjoyable reads.
- [Portland Civic Life Mapping](https://www.prcprojects.us/civic) - I found another tool that provides data about Portland. Will be looking into this more and surely doing some projects around it. This particular tool is powered by ESRI.
- [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/) - found this neat design tool from a youtube video. It's kind of like Dribbble, except that it's mostly existing sites (like Linear) and you can search by UI elements, like you can search for "settings" and it'll show you a bunch of examples of settings. I'm finding it super useful as I'm playing around with little prototypes, and especially areas of designs where I don't want to be clever - I just want something that's more or less conventional and works.
- [Gliese Art Collective](https://gliese.arceus.day/) - I found one of their zines at a coffee shop here in Portland and I followed the url on the back. It's "a student-led community devoted to promoting accessible education and analysis of radical art history" and it's run by local high schoolers!
- Some great personal websites from [Tobias Fried](https://tobiasfried.com/) and [Helena Zhang](https://www.helenazhang.com/). I think they collaborated with each other on their sites. The little sticky notes on Tobias's site are draggable and I love the animations & color & z-index change on hover. On Helena's site, I like the use of the grid, and I've especially interested in sites that don't use any center-alignment, which can give this very trustworthy, everything-in-its-place feel - the current version of the NY Times does something like this. I also really like the link hover animation on her site. And the gray-scale except on hover. It's so nice.
- Another great personal website from [Ahn](https://anhvn.com/)
- [Free Public APIs](https://www.freepublicapis.com/) and they're tested each day so they're known to be working
- [Projection Lab](https://projectionlab.com/) A cool tool for projecting personal finances. I'm impressed by conditional events, and other modeling features that make it more helpful and realistic.
- [Devcods](https://devdocs.io/). I wish I'd known about this sooner. I'm frequently downloading HTML files of docs and writing little tools for it so I can read docs offline.
- I'm checking [Follow the Crypto](https://www.followthecrypto.org/) to stay up to date on if crypto is spending on any elections near me. At last check, crypto wasn't interested in the elections that I'm voting in.
- I've been loving Piccalil's series on [redesigning their site](https://piccalil.li/blog/redesigning-piccalilli-the-second-part-of-the-design-process/) and hearing about their process
- [A spreadsheet engine Python](https://jamesg.blog/2024/08/21/spreadsheet-engine/) with [code](https://github.com/capjamesg/spreadsheet/tree/main)
- [Aider](https://aider.chat/) - An "Aider is AI pair programming in your terminal" that I really liked using. I'm not using it everyday, but I imagine it'll get better and I'll get better at using it.
- [Middle Age and Absences](https://harihareswara.net/posts/2024/middle-age-and-absences/) - I started reading Mel Chua's blog and research a few years ago and have been admiring them since. It felt fresh, creative, and invigorated me to think about the world differently. This was an incredibly sad read, but also one of the most amazing, thoughtful obituaries I've ever read.
