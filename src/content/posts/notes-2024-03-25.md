## What I'm Reading

I read [Let's Become Fungal](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/let-s-become-fungal) by Yasmine Ostendorf-Rodr√≠guez. This was one of the best non-fiction books I've read in the last few years. It reviews what we can learn from fungi to live better and more ethically.

[Valiz](https://valiz.nl/): The publisher of Let's Become Fungal who has many amazing books.

[Future Materials Bank](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/): A collection of "materials that support the transition towards a more sustainable artistic practice"
Here are the pages on [kombucha](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/kombucha/) and [scoby](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/scoby-compo-handbags-crafting-organic-waste-for-fashion/).

"How will you useless to capitalism today?" - [The Nap Ministry](https://thenapministry.wordpress.com/2021/08/03/how-will-you-be-useless-to-capitalism-today/)

I'm considering adding an email subscription to this site, and I'm thinking I'd use Ghost. Here's [one account](https://www.citationneeded.news/citation-needed-has-a-new-home) of switching from Substack to Ghost that I've found useful.

I read half of [The Undercommons](https://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=516) by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten.

I read [The Three-Body Problem](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-three-body-problem-cixin-liu/265918?ean=9780765382030) by Liu Cixin.

## What I'm Doing

I'm trying out [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) in place of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - which are both supercharged spotlight alternatives on macs. So far I'm really impressed by Raycast's speed, power, and how easy it is to configure. This [post](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/alfred-raycast) from Josh Collinsworth is a good comparison of Alfred and Raycast.

I'm learning to play [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge).

I'm doing the NY Times and LA Times daily mini crosswords.

I added an InfoButton web component where a user can click an info icon to view more information about a topic. You can see it in action on the [lists](/lists) page and source code is [here](https://github.com/aled1027/alexledger.net/blob/main/src/components/InfoButton.js). (Disclaimer: it's still a work in progress.) I made it a web component, instead of an astro component, so I can use it in `.md` files, not just `.mdx` and `.astro` files.

I updated [knowportland.org](https://knowportland.org) to use the [Astro Starlight theme](https://starlight.astro.build/). I also made a [Portland News tool](https://knowportland.org/tools/portland_news) that aggregates news from area newspapers, neighborhood publications and more.

I've been playing around with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for database/backend functionality and [Render](https://render.com/) for infrastructure. I like elements of both, but I'm still undecided on if I'd use them for a major project. I'm hesitant to run too far with Supabase because I feel like there'd quickly be lock-in with using their user management and edge functions for additional processing, especially when standing up Django with Postgres is so easy and flexible for me.

## Other Things

I want to check out [Rose City Reads](https://www.friends-library.org/), a bookstore from Friends of the Library which sells a combination of donated items and retired library materials.
