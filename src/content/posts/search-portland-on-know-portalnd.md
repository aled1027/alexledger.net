A new feature has arrived on [Know Portland](https://knowportland.org): the [Search Portland](https://knowportland.org/tools/search_portland) tool!

[Search Portland](https://knowportland.org/tools/search_portland) is a simple search generator that lets you quickly search across Portland-area publications.

**WHY** With the decline of search tools, it's become more challenging for me to search for information about Portland. For example, I wanted to read about some articles written a few months after Measure 110 was passed, but I had trouble crafting the right google/duckduckgo search to find those articles.

**AIM** This tool aims to solve that problem: limit the scope of the search to local publications, which write about Portland, so that the other, irrelevant results are immediately filtered out.

**HOW** The tool has a list of Portland-area URLs. Users select the URLs they'd like to search and type in their search term. The tool generates a link to google with the search query embedded, which users can click on to see the results.
