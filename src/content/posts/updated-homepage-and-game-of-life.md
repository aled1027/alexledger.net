title: Updated Homepage and Game of Life

If you made it here, you might have noticed the updated [homepage](/) of this site ðŸ‘€ .

I've been working through some courses on design, and after trying out a few ideas on [CodePen](https://codepen.io), I moved forward with this one. It's very, very inspired by [konvoy.vc](https://konvoy.vc/), which I've loved since I first laid eyes on it.

For my personal site, I wanted zones where I could play and easily show off concepts. I liked the multi-column grid to keep things orderly, and contrast with my previous layout that was too vertical.

I like the green primary color instead of the boring, corporate blue from before. I've tried to go single color with a couple neutral colors and that shade of green. I kept the green simple by finding a hue I liked, and then varying it's lightness using [oklch](https://oklch.com/).

I wanted a design that would communicate the following qualities about me: experimental, diverse interests, and playful.
I hope that the grid boxes and the variety within them demonstrates diverse interests. And the nature of the content in the boxes themselves should communicate the experimental and playful qualities.

The first fun box I've added is a canvas that plays game of life. Users can click three buttons - play, pause, and resume - to manage the game and they can click into the canvas to make individual cells come alive. This was a pretty basic proof-of-concept of what could be done in one of the grid boxes.

The version you see now is certainly somewhere in the journey and not the destination.
