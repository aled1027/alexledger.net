## What I'm Reading

- [Let's Become Fungal](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/let-s-become-fungal) by Yasmine Ostendorf-Rodr√≠guez
  - I just finished this book, and this was one of the best non-fiction books I've read in the last few years
  - It reviews what we can learn from fungi to live more ethically and with understanding
- [Valiz](https://valiz.nl/): The publisher of Let's Become Fungal who has many amazing books
- [Future Materials Bank](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/): A collection of "materials that support the transition towards a more sustainable artistic practice"
  - Here're the pages on [kombucha](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/kombucha/] and [scoby](https://www.futurematerialsbank.com/material/scoby-compo-handbags-crafting-organic-waste-for-fashion/)
