Hello my readers.

I wanted to give you all a quick heads up that things around here are going to be changing over the next month.

I’m coming up on the one year mark of leaving Playground Labs, and to my absolute and utter shock and glee, I think I’ve figured out what I want to do with my career and life (at least for now).

I’m getting all the ducks in a row and will have more solid information about the plans in early January. Until then, you may see things changing around here as I get things prepared.

p.s. I haven’t posted much yet, but if you want to follow me, the best way is through Bluesky. When I write a blog post, I’ll always make sure to post over there.
