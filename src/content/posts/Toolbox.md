## General Tools

| Tool                                           | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)            | Spotlight alternative that is customizable, faster, and really fun to use.                                                                    |
| [Proton Mail](https://mail.proton.me/)         | A private, trustworthy, non-google email provider.                                                                                            |
| [Proton Calendar](https://calendar.proton.me/) | A private, non-google calendar.                                                                                                               |
| [Obsidian](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)      | Note taking app with great plugins. I love that behind the scenes, it's all just simple mark down files in a repository.                      |
| [1Password](https://1password.com/)            | My preferred password manager. I've also used LastPass and KeepassX and found that I like the UI, UX, and sharing features of 1pass the most. |
| [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/)              | My RSS Feed reader. I've used newsblur for a few years and love it. I pay annually.                                                           |



## Development Tools

| Tool                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Github](https://github.com/)                       | I use github for hosting a lot of data, even beyond code.                                                                                                                                                            |
| [ Github Actions](https://github.com/)              | I use github actions for most automation. I separated this out from GitHub because I like GitHub actions so much and there are so many alternatives                                                                  |
| [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)                 | I host most of my sites on netlify, deploying using their git integration.                                                                                                                                           |
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)           | VSCode with the vim plugin is my current development environment of choice. I wouldn't say it's the best thing ever, but it's pretty good and gets the job done.                                                     |
| [Docker & Docker Compose ](https://www.docker.com/) | I like docker for quickly making reproduce-able environments, like for running MySQL locally.                                                                                                                        |
| [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)               | I use pre-commit to auto-run a series of checks on code before committing. Super nice way to enforce formatting requriements before code even hits CI/CD.                                                            |
| [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)                | Poetry is my preferred dependency management system for python.                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh)                             | Anytime I need notifications, I use ntfy. Ntfy has an open and inter-operaple model for notifications that work across devices, platforms, and user settings.                                                        |
| [Astro](https://astro.build)                        | My go-to frontend framework (meta-framework?) for working on websites. I'll often combine with svelte.                                                                                                               |
| Postgres                                            | I use postgres as my go-to database for my projects. I haven't found my preferred Postgres as a service provider yet. I like the supabase experience, but they spin you down on the free tier after some inactivity. |


## Honorable Mentions

| Tool                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) | As an alternative to jupyter, Marimo is a python notebook package. I like it more than jupyter because (a) it's reactive, tracking variables and dependencies and (b), perhaps more valuable for me, it creates nice python files that have super easy to read diffs, and I spend so much time reading and evaluating diffs, even for my personal projects. |
| [Rye](https://rye-up.com/)   | An experimental dependency and environment manager for Python that I found really easy and intuitive to use. Excited to see where it goes. I much prefer it to poetry or pip or anything else I've used in the python ecosystem                                                                                                                             |
