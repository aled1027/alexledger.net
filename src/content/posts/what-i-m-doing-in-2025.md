It's 2025, and I want to update you all on some exciting developments.


## 1: A Solo Web Agency

I'm doing freelance website work where I design and build websites for small businesses, writers, and artists.
Because I offer the option of design, implementation, copywriting, and advising, it has the feel of a solo web agency more than freelancing.

Beyond just making a website, I want to help folks navigate the website landscape. There are so many
different platforms (like Squarespace, Wix, Framer) and tools (e.g., do you need a reservation system - what are the options) that it's daunting and challenging to build a website when you're not deep in the space, and, on top of that, you've got a business to run.

If you know someone interested in a website, have them email me at [hello@alexledger.net](hello@alexledger.net).
I'm happy to do a free 30-minute consultation.

## 2. inContext Notebooks

[InContext](https://incontext.fun) is my startup that I started with Miguel last year that builds language learning tools. In the fall of 2024, we released the inContext Browser extension that defines words and phrases leveraging the context around it and displays the definition in the target language of the language learner at their current level.

The extension was super fun to write, and I recommend that you check it out.

In 2025, Miguel and I have our sights set on something bigger: we're building a new product called __inContext Notebooks__. I've written up an overview of inContext Notebooks on my [Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/alexledger/p/incontext-notebooks-report-1-a-prototype?r=324f62&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).

## 3. Substack

And that brings me to the final update: [I'm writing on Substack!](https://alexledger.substack.com)

I'm writing about language learning, product development, websites, and other adjacent topics. I'm looking to post weekly, so if you're interested in reading what I'm thinking about, check it out.

The [most recent post](https://open.substack.com/pub/alexledger/p/this-is-how-we-do-things-at-incontext?r=324f62&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) was an excerpt from an internal doc at inContext about our company building and product philosophy, which feels like more of a life philosophy than a work philosophy.
