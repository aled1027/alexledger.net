In today's post I'm listing research I've been collecting on sabbaticals.
It's not much, but it's been more than enough to get me thinking and planning.

- [Matt Mullenweg (Founder of Automattic) on the Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/2023/12/29/matt-mullenweg-2/)
  - Tim asks some fun questions about how Matt's thinking about his Sabbatical, like "If after the sabbatical you reflect that it failed, what's the most likely reason that it failed?"
- [Automattic's Employees on Sabbaticals](https://automattic.com/sabbatical/)
  - As part of working at Automattic, the company behind Wordpress, employees get a 3 month sabbatical every five years.
- [Tim Ferris: How to Take a Mini-Retirement: Tips and Tricks](https://www.getrichslowly.org/how-to-take-a-mini-retirement-tips-and-tricks-from-timothy-ferriss/)
  - This particular interview is focused on traveling on the cheap
- [Jillian Johnsrud on Mini-Retirements](https://www.jillianjohnsrud.com/category/mini-retirements/)
  - Jillian is interviewed about the ideas on the [ChooseFI podcast](https://www.choosefi.com/unlocking-your-first-mini-retirement-with-jillian-johnsrud-ep-333/)
  - Some ideas I liked from Jillian:
    - Expect to be bad at the mini retirement
    - Have a plan for when you mini retire
