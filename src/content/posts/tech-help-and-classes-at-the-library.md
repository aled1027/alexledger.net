Since February I've been volunteering at Tech Help Drop-in sessions at the library. Library patrons come by Tuesdays 1:00pm and 3:00pm at the Woodstock Library in Portland, Oregon, and I, along with other volunteers, help them one on one with any of their tech questions.

The questions range from setting up gmail, learning about google docs, issues with internet speed, filling out government forms online, and so on. Every week is something new and different.
