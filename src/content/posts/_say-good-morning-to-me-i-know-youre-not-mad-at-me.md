title: Say good morning to me so I know you're not mad at me
---

Say good morning to me so I know you're not mad at me.
I'm not sure if you're in a bad mood. If you aren't, I'm not sure if I contributed.
If I did, I want to repair.

I wash more dishes, dishes I wouldn't do otherwise, hoping that might repair the thing I'm not sure I did.
I can't tell if it worked.
