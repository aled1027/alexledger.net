title: My Writing Guidelines
---

1. When referencing books, include a link to the book on [indiebound.org](https://www.indiebound.org/).
2. Don't include an h1 within the post, let the website template handle that. Include the title in post metadata.
3. When referencing an individual, use their full name. This avoids issues with accidentally referencing individuals by only first or only last name and reduces ambiguity.
4. Be liberal with the use of tags. Error on the side of too many tags.
5. Use footnotes when you feel like it. They're fun. I may someday additionally support sidenotes.
