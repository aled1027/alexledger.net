Oregon has a unique law where when the state has more revenue than predicted, it must be refund the some of the surplus to taxpayers.

It's a nice idea: the state had too much so it should give it back. But, as I understand it and think about it, it's not a great approach to managing the Oregon budget.

### When does the kicker kick in?

The process is like this:

1. Two years before, economists predict how much revenue the state will take in over a two-year period.
2. State lawmakers build a budget based on the revenue predictions.
3. If the actual amount of revenue exceeds the prediction by more than 2%, the surprlus is returned to taxpapers

### How much does each person get?

The most recent forecast was off by roughly 25%, resulting in a $5.6 billion kicker for 2023 Oregon taxpayers.

According to OPB, "itâ€™s more general fund money than lawmakers spent in the current budget on public safety, courts, colleges and universities or many other nuts-and-bolts services." (https://www.opb.org/article/2023/12/15/oregon-kicker-law-record-tax-spending/)

- "The wealthiest one percent of Oregon taxpayers received 1/5th of the refund" in 2007 (wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_tax_rebate)

### What Do Other States Do?

I'm not really sure, but as far as I'm aware, no other state has a law like the Oregon kicker. Other states must spend the money they collected, like they do other taxes.

The kicker is interestingly, and particularly, possible in Oregon where most revenue comes from income tax; a kicker in a state without income tax, like Washington, wouldn't really make sense.

### Concerns I have with the Kicker

1. Depending on prediction is dangerous, and it's becoming increasingly dangerous and challenging as the world becomes harder to predict.

No one knew in April 2019 that in a year everyone would be quarantined at home for a pandemic.
No one knew in that economic recovery from the pandemic in the United States would dramatically outpace of the rest of the world, avoid inflation (on the whole), economic stagnation, and defy historical economic responses to pandemics.
No one knew in August 2001 that the U.S. would be engaged in a multi-decade costly overseas war in a matter of months.
No one knows when the Big One is going to hit.

The world is getting wild and harder to predict. One thing that I'm sure improves resilience is building systems that robust to mispredictions because we just simply don't know what's going to happen. We should absolutely keep trying to forecast because it's critical we maintain an awareness, but we, at the same time, must acknowledge the challenge inherent there.

The kicker is by it's very nature strongly trying Oregon's wellbeing to prediction. Oregon schools, services, and everything under the sun is now impacted by prediction, and more importantly mis-prediction.

This is fine right now, I suppose, we went over surplus, but that does mean that we didn't invest back into our schools proportional the amount of money that moved around the state: I view the kicker as an indicator that we under-funded our society relative to our intention.

There will be times, of course, when we over-forecast revenue and are underfunded. This could create a bust-only no-boom cycle where we struggle hard when times aren't good and we only do okay when times are good - not really able to store up and build up when we have the wealth to do so.

2. The Wealthiest Oregonians Get the Most Back

Everyone is getting 44.28% of their 2022 taxes back.

You know who's not getting a refund? Anyone who didn't make enough to need to pay taxes.
You know who's not getting a big kicker? Folks who don't make that much because Oregon has a graduated income tax.

The kicker itself doesn't even factor in graduated income tax and tax tiers.
