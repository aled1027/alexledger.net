Ten of my favorite things of 2023.

Criteria: these are my favorite things I encountered in 2023; many of them came out in 2023, but that's not a requirement to make the list.


### 1. [Looking for Alice](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice) by Henrik Karlsson

A wonderful, thoughtful reflection on partnerships.

### 2. [Meta in Myanmar](https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series) by Erin Kissane

In 6 posts, Erin Kissane outlines the role that Meta played in Myanmar in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. To me, this is an absolute must read. It captures the modern role of the United States abroad, particularly outside a military context. It describes how genocide and oppression are occurring in the modern era.

### 3. [Eldercare, Family Caretaking, and End-of-life Logistics: Stuff I Learned](https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2023/eldercare-family-caretaking-end-of-life-logistics-learned/) by Sumana Hariharesware

After Sumana Hariharesware's mother passed away, they wrote a thorough review of things they learned by going through the process.

I've long been thinking about resources for folks to help their partners, who may have a chronic health condition, navigate the healthcare system in the United States, as it's not an easy thing and support can go far.

I can't express enough gratitude to Sumana Hariharesware for writing this. It helped me better understand how I can support others and helped me navigate my partner's chronic health issues and their surgery.

### 4. [Scholomance Trilogy](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-deadly-education-naomi-novik/14143485?ean=9780593128503) by Naomi Novik

The Scholomance Trilogy is the best fiction I read this year.

### 5. [On Freedom](https://bookshop.org/p/books/on-freedom-four-songs-of-care-and-constraint-maggie-nelson/15911469?ean=9781644452028) by Maggie Nelson

The best non-fiction I read this year. I don't understand how Maggie Nelson can write so aggressively and delicately at the same time. I never feel like she's shying away from a hard issue, adding nuance, hedging, any of those things. I admire it and want more of it in my life.

### 6. [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) by Mike Caulfield

A big theme of 2023 for me was thinking about websites. What are websites, when should they exist, how should they be structured, and so on. 

One key event that made me really think about websites was when the British Columbia Transportation Ministry was blocked by Twitter from posting during the British Columbia wildfires in July ([src](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/twitter-policy-change-hampers-drivebc-1.6894793)). Their twitter account reached its post rate limit while tweeting out wildfire road information that was essential for residents. This continued a conversation that was big in 2022/2023: is twitter (and social media at large) an essential service?

I'm leaving 2023 thinking that even if it is an essential service, it really shouldn't be. It's dangerous to rely on private pipes to delivery essential information, and we should be working towards building more resilient information delivery systems.

[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) discusses ideas like this. He's reflecting the internet as a stream, where we contribute to the flow of the stream and we watch the stream as it flows by. This is contrasted with the image of a garden, that grows and is adjusted in-place over time.

### 7. [My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/) by Laurel Schwulst

The title of this post struck me with its resonance to [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) discussed above.

What is a website and what can it be? Can we expand how we think about the internet beyond something that we post to, something we scroll, and something that we use for work & navigation.
 
### 8. [Science of Kombucha Brewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulZr3gkEl-I) by [Cultured Analysis](https://www.culturedanalysis.com/)

This is the single best resource I've found on Kombucha. It goes over how kombucha breaks down its starting tea and sugar into a delicious beverage, including how the different compounds contribute various flavors.

### 9. [Critical Ignoring as a Core Competence for Digital Citizens](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09637214221121570)

Navigating the internet is challenging, and I want to acknowledge that up-front. I'm not sure that it's ever been easy, but it's become such a large part of our lives that it deserves attention and skill-building.

> "We argue that digital information literacy must include the competence of critical ignoring—choosing what to ignore and where to invest one’s limited attentional capacities."

This paper got me started down this journey of trying to learn how to use the internet more effectively. One of my favorite things in the paper is lateral reading.

> Lateral reading begins with a key insight: One cannot necessarily know how trustworthy a website or a social-media post is by engaging with and critically reflecting on its content. Without relevant background knowledge or reliable indicators of trustworthiness, the best strategy for deciding whether one can believe a source is to look up the author or organization and the claims elsewhere (e.g., using search engines or Wikipedia to get pointers to reliable sources).

> 
> Instead of dwelling on an unfamiliar site (i.e., reading vertically), fact-checkers strategically and deliberately ignored it until they first opened new tabs to search for information about the organization or individual behind it. If lateral reading indicates that the site is untrustworthy, examining it directly would waste precious time and energy. Although this strategy might require motivation and time to learn and practice, it is a time-saver in the long run. In the study just mentioned, fact-checkers needed only a few seconds to determine trustworthiness of the source.

### 10. [Responsive Web Design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) by Ethan Marcotte

This is the classic post introducing the concepts of responsive web design. I love how big Ethan Marcotte is thinking in this, considering websites as so much more than things we read on our current devices
