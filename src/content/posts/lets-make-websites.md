**tl;dr: I'm now offering freelance web work. Reach out if you're interested!**

## The Web as a Connector

Each morning I sit down next to my sleeping cat with a cup of coffee, open my laptop, and lose myself in the magic of the web. I find myself transported – into a [writer's digital garden](https://aworkinglibrary.com/) blooming with ideas, into a [chef's interactive culinary journey](https://www.culturedpickleshop.com/blog/2024/9/6/rice-amp-pickles-august-31-amp-september-1), into an [artist's carefully curated world of imagination](https://www.robinsloan.com/). Each great website isn't just a collection of pages and buttons – it's a door to new experiences, ideas, and connections.

The web's power isn't just in its technology – it's in moments of discovery and connection, when someone's passion reaches through the screen and pulls you in. I've spent years crafting these web experiences across industries, watching as they transform from initial concepts into living, breathing spaces that serve their audiences in ways that continually surprise and inspire me. Each project has taught me that a thoughtfully built website can ripple outward in its impact, far beyond its original purpose.

**But far too often, I see passionate people and businesses held back by websites that don't match their vision.** Maybe you're a business owner whose site isn't converting visitors into customers. Or an artist whose portfolio doesn't capture the spirit of your work. Or maybe you're just starting out, staring at a blank canvas of possibilities.

I want to help people realize the potential of a good website. The way it can invite, inspire, and connect. **That’s why I’m excited to announce that I’m now helping others build their perfect corner of the web through freelance web work.** Whether you need a sleek, professional presence or a bold, creative showcase, I help you build the right digital home to share your vision with the world.

I work with everyone from established businesses looking to modernize their online presence to individuals ready to carve out their first digital space. What matters isn't where you're starting – it's where you want to go.

The web has given me a place to share my work and connect with amazing people. Now, I want to help you do the same. Ready to build something remarkable?

## Why Me?

Why can I help you? I’m passionate about building the right thing for the right person for the right users.

I know from first-hand experience how challenging it can be to build something that serves the needs and addresses the problems of your users, customers and stakeholders. It is my mission to build software that is not only robust and efficient, but also elegant: software that people actually enjoy interacting with and want to use.

I’ve worked on a range of exciting projects. Right now, I’m working on and maintaining:

- [inContext](https://incontext.fun): A smart dictionary for language learning. inContext uses the latest AI to look up words and define them in your target language, at your level, leveraging the context of the word.
- [Compass](https://thelittlecompass.com): A tool for building a list of awesome places to visit when your friends travel to the places you know.
- [Know Portland](https://knowportland.org): A compendium of information for Portland residents to make their lives a little bit more informed.

In the past, I’ve worked on some pretty cool projects.

- I’ve built [secure privacy-preserving computational frameworks](https://digital.gov/resources/privacy-preserving-collaboration-using-cryptography/#rapid-assembly-of-mpc-protocols-ramp) for the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security.
- I’ve incorporated state-of-the-art [graph databases](https://altair.com/altair-graph-studio) at the Food and Drug Administration, Bank of New York Mellon, and major hedge funds.
- I’ve built software for managing, navigating, and delegating in decentralized crypto organizations.
- I’ve built video games.
- I’ve built systems to detect hail damage to roofs from drone footage (before the AI revolution which made this problem almost too easy).
- I’ve built children’s exhibits for the OMSI (that, unfortunately to my knowledge, weren’t put on display).

I’m also passionate about technical education.

- I volunteer at the [Multnomah County Library assisting adults with technical assistance](https://www.alexledger.net/posts/tech-help-and-classes-at-the-library).
- I volunteer at the [Library teaching kids how to code](https://multcolib.org/events-classes/code-and-create-teens).
- I’ve helped run a [week-long cryptography summer school for high schoolers](https://www.ll.mit.edu/outreach/llcipher).
- I write on my [website](https://www.alexledger.net/posts) about web technologies.

## How I Work

I work in collaboration with you. I like to start projects with a quick 15 minute call to learn as much about you and your work as I can. I want to learn what makes you tick; why do you wake up each morning to work on this, and what is important to you.

From there, we’ll start iterating on ideas. I like to communicate succinctly and appropriately. I know that you’re busy \- I’m busy too \- so I keep the communication short and sweet. I really like sending short videos with progress so that you can see what’s happening and provide feedback as things progress.

We’ll work in tandem. I’m working to manifest your vision.

## What’s Important to Me

The single most important thing to me is that your website serves your audience. A website, just like a restaurant, is only as good as the experience it delivers to its patrons.

Together, we’ll figure out what your audience wants and how to best deliver that to them. If your audience is getting what they want, then you’re doing your job. And if you’re doing your job, then I’m doing my job.

## How to Get Started

Does that get you excited? Want to build a website together?
