## A Fermentation Tool Library

Are there libraries of fermentation tools, where folks can borrow fermentation equipment to play with various ferments? It'd be a gateway to try out fermentation, or a new kind of fermentation, and lower the barrier to entry.

I might consider starting one at some point, especially if it could be connected with an existing food insitution, like a food coop.

## Fermentation Apps

In a recent [post](/posts/writing-a-check-in-app), I described how I made a little app for my partner to some of their health issues. In a similar vein, I've been thinking about what fermentation apps might look like to support fermentation.

I really doubt that an app is needed - I was just reading [The Case for a Paper Journal](https://2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com/the-case-for-a-paper-journal/), which argues for not using fitness apps (and I'm personally compelled (but I already don't use them)) - but supposing I wanted one, what would it do and afford?

I came across this set of apps from [HakkoBako](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6717451513204474563), which, from a quick skim, support a fermentation reminders app and a general timeline tracker app for tracking, including pictures, ferments.

## Investing in Fermentation Systems

I've been bumping up my fermentation systems over the last week. I reorganized my office to better support my ferments, started an apple cider vinegar, started a ginger bug, made a batch of tempeh, and have ongoing kombucha & kraut.

I'm looking to keep expanding out what's happening there to learn more, make more delicious foods, save money, and see if I can help other folks eat more fermented, less processed foods.

One thing that I'd like to think about more is homestead-scale. Right now I'd say I'm at "hobbyist-scale", where I make enough for a few people. But I'd like to get to the point where I can make enough for 10ish people, which might be the equivalent of "five-gallon-bucket" size ferments.

## A Ferments Section

I started a ferments section on this website that can be found at [https://alexledger.net/ferments](/ferments). It shows off ongoing ferments, recent ferments, some guides I've written, and other general information around fermentation.

## A Bump of Inspiration

I just finished reading [Let's Become Fungal](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/let-s-become-fungal), which prompted me to think more about fermentation, art and so many other things that I'll write about later.
