## Projects

Since I started my sabbatical about 3 months ago, I've been doing a ton of little projects. They've been fun and rewarding and interesting, so I wanted to share them here.

I love listing and posting these things because it gives me a sense of accomplishment.
We had a cat-therapist-team come over and help us with our cats, and one cool thing they told us about was building cats' confidences from play: a primary goal of playing with cats is that when they catch the toy, and when they get up higher vertically in the room, they get more confidence which helps them be happier and interact with other cats and humans better.
I've been thinking about that for myself and those around me. I definitely use little projects as play and a way to boost my confidence because it's so fun to do things and finish them and share them with others.
