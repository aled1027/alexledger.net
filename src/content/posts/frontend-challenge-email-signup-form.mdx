import EmailSignUpForm from "@components/EmailSignUpForm.svelte";

<EmailSignUpForm client:only />


This was my approach to the Piccalil frontend challenge to build an [email sign-up form](https://piccalil.li/blog/challenge-001-email-sign-up-form/)[^1].
See the source code [here](https://github.com/aled1027/alexledger.net/blob/main/src/components/EmailSignUpForm.svelte) on GitHub.

[^1]: Because I wasn't sure about accessibility and validation pieces, I did quite a bit of research (and read Piccalil's [solution](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/solution-001-email-sign-up-form/)). And I didn't implement a success state.
