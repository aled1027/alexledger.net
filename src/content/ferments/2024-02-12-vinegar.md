I followed a general aggregation of online recipes from Zero-waste Chef, Kristen Shockley and Sandor Katz.

1. Mix 12 oz warm water and 3 T sugar in a large mason jar
2. Add apple scraps (I added one apple, cut up thinly-ish)
3. Add some apple cider vinegar
4. Top with water to fill jar
5. Cover with cloth

The plan is to mix it every day.
