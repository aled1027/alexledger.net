Our house has had a sourdough starter going (with a few resets here and there) for about 4 years now. We don't make a ton of breads, but, for some reason, we still keep a sourdough starter fed and happy.

We almost always use the discard for delicious sourdough pancakes. Which in my opinion is more than enough reason to have a sourdough starter around.
