Started the recipe based on Better Done Yourself's approach in their youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xxb-yt0FZw).

Day 1:

1. Add 1 cup of water to a 16 ounce mason jar.
2. Add 1 tablespoons (or 8 grams) of ginger, cut up (small, but doesn't need to be minced).
3. Add 1 tablespoons (or 8 grams) of white sugar.
4. Stir

Feed the ginger bug each day by:

1. Add 1 tablespoons (or 8 grams) of ginger, cut up (small, but doesn't need to be minced).
2. Add 1 tablespoons (or 8 grams) of white sugar.
3. Stir
