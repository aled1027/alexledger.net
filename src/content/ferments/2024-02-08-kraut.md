Making one cabbage plus some carrots of Kraut.

Cat set up this ferment. We typically follow Sandor Katz's sauerkraut recipe from The Art of Fermentation, which, for us, is:

1. Cut up the kraut and other veggies (we often add carrots and radish).
   - We typically cut the kraut quite thin and the carrots and radishes are grated
2. Put all the veggies in a large bowl
3. Add salt - we often do about 1% of the weight of the veggies
4. Massage for a few minutes
5. Let sit for about 30 minutes
6. Massage again for a few minutes
7. Pack into the crock, and tamp down. Put weights on top
8. Let it go. We've found we don't need to let ours go super long, so we'll usually start eating out of the crock after about a week and pack into the fridge after 10 to 14 days.
