1. Soak 2 cups soybeans for 12 to 24 hours.
2. Cook in instant pot, 27 minutes plus natural release.
3. Heat and dry on stove.
4. Add vinegar and let the beans cool to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
5. Add tempeh starter powder, mix throughout carefully, without breaking up the beans too much
6. Punch holes in the ziploc bags. I punch a hole about every half inch.
7. Pack the beans into ziploc bags and make into sandwich-like thickness.
8. Place the bags in the dehydrators at 95 degrees for 24 hours.
9. After 24 hours, turn off the dehydrator. The beans should be able to keep themselves warm, as the ferment is active. Let sit another 24 or so hours until they're solid and done.
