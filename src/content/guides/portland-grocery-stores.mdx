What could I do in the next hour?

- List them out
- Find them using openmaps
  - Or overture - https://overturemaps.org/overture-maps-foundation-releases-first-world-wide-open-map-dataset/
    - https://til.simonwillison.net/overture-maps/overture-maps-parquet
- Something using dbpediea
- A quick table
- Could a chris coyier burrito style design
- **What's the point I'm trying to get across? The owners and that the situation isn't awesome.**
	- Also, remind people of the bad things, because we forget the shit that's gone down.
