## Introduction

Cooperatives (coops) are "**people-centred** enterprises **jointly owned and democratically controlled** by and for their members to realise their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations" (emphasis added)[^1].

While their role is generally understood to support social and economic aspects of its constituents, the shape, size, and framework for coops is specific to the time, place, and culture of their location, participants, and nature of business.

This getting up to speed on coops is centered on the authors locality - Portland, Oregon - so many of the ideas and examples and histories are derived from there.

- Action: Finding a Coop
- Background: The impact of the pandemic
- Value during challenges: What Portland coops did during the pandemic, fires?
  - Disability, Health: Extended masking suggestions at the store, including a few hours each day (even in 2024) of mandatory masking. This is to support those with health issues in our community - and those who live and work them. It's generally a good practice in the winter, especially in close quarters.
