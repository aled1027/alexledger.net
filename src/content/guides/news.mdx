In an effort to improve the quality of my news consumption and research and vet insitutions in my life, I've put together a short guide on smaller news organization.
For each organization, I research their revenue model, investors, owners, and founders to understand their institutional aims and incentivies.
In this guide, I've listed organizations who _passed the test_: upon doing the background research, they were up to snuff.[^1] And I've included the information along with as many links as possible below.

Note that this is far from thorough. I have not looked at many news organizations and it's entirely possible that some of these news organizations shouldn't be on the list.
That being said, to the best of my present knowledge, I can recommend these. If you come across information to the contrary, please feel free to reach out to me to so we can keep this list high quality.

## News Organizations That Are Somewhat Researched
